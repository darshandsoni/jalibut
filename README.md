# Jalibut
Jalibut is an open-source "search ahead" based directory that can be used to showcase any collection of entities.

## Why?
Jalibut stems from the need to live search collections of entities. It could be anything: repositories, projects, cars, specimens... the list is endless. Jalibut provides a simple platform to elegantly showcase collections and live search them with nothing more than clean CSS, a JSON directory and some JavaScript to search it.

## Use
Jalibut is just a framework to help you quickly get started with showcasing a collection. Use it as is or build up on it to make your content more accessible.
